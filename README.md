# ‚è≤Ô∏è Timer_based_on_atmega_altium_project.github.io

This project is a professional-grade **Timer Alarm** system designed using the ATMEGA microcontroller. The project supports multiple time-based functionalities such as **Alarms**, **Stopwatch**, and other similar features. 

It integrates several critical components, including a **7-segment display**, **buzzer**, and **buttons** for user interaction, making it a fully functional and versatile timing device.

The design includes clear divisions for power management, alarm control, and display. It‚Äôs a perfect example of how professional PCB designs are structured for easy maintenance and scalability.

### üí° **Main Features:**
- **Power Management**: Handles stable power delivery using capacitors, voltage regulators, and a fuse for protection.
- **Alarm Control**: The system includes a buzzer that sounds when the timer is triggered, controlled efficiently by a MOSFET.
- **User Input**: Multiple buttons for setting, starting, and resetting the timer or stopwatch.
- **Display Interface**: 7-segment display driven by **74HC595** shift registers for real-time display of timer values.
- **Programming Interface**: Easy-to-use **PROG PIN** for programming through SPI.

This project showcases the process of building and designing PCBs with a focus on both functionality and power efficiency, making it an ideal reference for hobbyists and professionals alike.
